# Naked-Dibellans-SPID
This mod makes Dibella priestesses naked, gives them a flower crown, and allows you to practice the "Dibellan Arts" with them and receive blessings.

You need SexLab﻿, Flower Girls﻿ or OStim for the sex animations. If one of them is not installed, you'll see a black screen. You can't do it again until after the blessings expired. After completing the quest that gives you the Agent of Dibella perk the Dibellan arts will become free. 

This console command can change the price which is 100 by default:
 

*set zzznpdDibellanCost to 50*

 

It uses SPID﻿ to change their outfits and doesn't edit their records so it's compatible with other mods that change their looks/stats. It can only conflict with other mods that also use SPID to change outfits of the same NPCs. You can delete the INI file to restore the outfits.

Female NPCs from other mods will also remove their clothes if they are in this faction: MarkarthTempleofDibellaFaction.

The ESP is flagged as an ESL so it doesn't count in the plugins limit.

 

This Mod doesn't change their bodies only removes their robes, you have to install a body mod like CBBE to remove their underwear.
